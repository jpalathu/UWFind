# Frontend

## Initial Setup
Install the dependencies.
```
npm i
```

## Running the Frontend
We're using [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/) as a build tool, so we can see Android, iOS, and web app

1. Go to frontend directory
```
cd frontend
```

2. Start the server and it'll open up a page in your browser with ways to see the app.
    ```
    npm run start
    ```

3. There's different ways, but you can scan the QR code that opens up in your browser and install the app from the App Store to see the changes live.
